## Project Description
Our design is centered around the option of
customizability, through our filter system job
recommendation tab, and job matching our website
design was made not only for students just starting out
in the job market, but also for people who are
experienced who are looking for something long-
term.  This project was made and designed to keep the
users' experience in mind.  We wanted to make a more
organized way for students to find jobs without having to
worry about ghost listings and companies not
responding to their resumes and job applications.    The
key features of our website are our extremely
customizable filter system.  This system allows our users
to find jobs catered to their specific talents and
skills.  Another one of the key features is our job
recommendation list, which is set up to match the users'
skill sets and job interests.​
